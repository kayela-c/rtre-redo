                    In 2014, after moving from Los Angeles back to her hometown
                    in Louisiana, she discovered a passion for real estate. She
                    started out wholesaling single family residential properties
                    then mobile home parks. In 2018, she began flipping houses.
                    This led to her also becoming a landlord. In 2020, she
                    decided to combine her two passions, writing and real estate
                    and created the Rock The Real Estate Newsletter to help
                    others. Her future plans are to continue flipping, building
                    her rental portfolio and building the Rock The Real Estate
                    brand.

                    to her children. In 2014, she started wholesaling with a
                    mentor and continued her education in real estate by
                    obtaining her real estate license in 2016. As a Realtor she
                    listed and sold single family homes in the Houston area.
                    Because of her passion to help others succeed, in 2020 she
                    joined forces with Lena Claybon to help build an educational

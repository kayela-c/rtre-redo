    <h2>6 Strategies For Real Estate Investing: Which One&#44;s For You?</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      As I mentioned in the opening, there are many strategies or ways to make
      money in real estate. I won&sbquo;t attempt to cover them all here but
      I&sbquo;m going to go over 6 popular ones. Once you know the various
      strategies, then you can choose the one that resonates with you and delve
      into that one to get started.
    </p>
    <p>So, with that said, let&sbquo;s get started.</p>
    <p>Strategy #1 &#8211 Wholesaling</p>
    <p>
      This is the strategy that a lot of beginning investors start with because
      it doesn&sbquo;t take a lot of money to get started and it doesn&sbquo;t
      take that long to learn how to do it. In a nutshell, wholesaling is
      finding a distressed property (distressed meaning, in need of repairs or
      the Owner is motivated to get rid of the house for any number of reasons),
      then, after finding the property, negotiating a price with the Seller that
      is (ideally) 30% &#8211 50% below market value, getting the house under
      contract, then finding a Buyer willing to buy the “contract” from you for
      a price higher than what you put it under contract for. You make the
      difference between the “contract” price with the Seller and the “assigned”
      price to the Buyer.
    </p>
    <img src="#" alt="" />
    <p>Strategy #2 &#8211 Fix and Flip</p>
    <p>
      This one is pretty simple, though not always easy. You buy a house in need
      of repairs (again under market value), fix it up, then sell it at market
      value or as close to it as you can get. You have to have a little money to
      do fix and flips, either your own cash or loans. Not only do you have to
      purchase the home, but you have to cover the cost of repairs. Some
      investors who prefer this strategy start with “house hacking” where they
      actually live in the house while they&sbquo;re repairing it, then when
      done, sell it and start over.
    </p>
    <p>Strategy #3 &#8211 Tax Liens</p>
    <p>
      Some people swear by this strategy. For me, it wasn&sbquo;t all that great
      but I did end up getting one deal when I tried it (I think the second
      time), so I thought it was worth covering here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a nutshell, tax lien investing is when people don&sbquo;t pay their
      annual property taxes, the local tax assessor&sbquo;s office puts a
      `lien&sbquo; against the property. If it goes unpaid, after so long, the
      property goes to sale in a tax auction in that county. Investors can buy
      those liens for the cost of the taxes owed. HOWEVER, you don&sbquo;t get
      the properties right away. There&sbquo;s a REDEMPTION PERIOD in which the
      Owner(s) have a certain amount of time to redeem their properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way an investor makes money is when the Owner does redeem the
      property, they have to pay the investor their money back plus the interest
      that&sbquo;s accrued which could be as high as 12%-18% typically. If they
      don&sbquo;t redeem the property, then the investor gets it for the amount
      of taxes paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be a great long play type investment if the investor is not in a
      rush to make money. Redemption periods can be 1-3 years depending on where
      you are. BUT, you can also go for adjudicated properties where the
      redemption period is already up but I&sbquo;ll get into that later in the
      future edition dedicated to “Tax Liens”.
    </p>
    <p>Strategy #4 &#8211 “Subject To”</p>
    <p>
      This can be another strategy you use when you don&sbquo;t have a lot of
      money upfront to invest.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Biggerpockets.com, the definition of “subject to”
      investing is… “a method of purchasing properties while leaving the
      sellerʼs loan in place. In essence, it allows you to not have to get new
      financing for the property. You are buying the property that is “subject
      to” the existing debt. The beauty of “subject to” investing is that you
      are not assuming the mortgage. All you are taking on is making payments on
      behalf of the original seller. This scenario provides the buyer with no
      personal liability/little risk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, you ask why would anyone do that? The buyer is helping the
      seller get out of a situation where they are in over their head dues to
      life changes such as a job loss or transfer, getting divorced, or just
      being financially strapped. This will give the seller instant debt relief
      and gives the buyer a house they now control to rent out without having to
      finance it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>Strategy #5 &#8211 “Buy and Hold”</p>
    <p>
      This is another term for buying rental properties. You are buying, not to
      resell, but to hold for a period of time or indefinitely as a way to
      receive passive income through renting. Some investors choose to “buy and
      hold” single-family homes only and amass a portfolio of single-family
      homes over time as a way to build wealth. Some invest in apartment
      buildings or commercial properties. You can pretty much apply any strategy
      to either type of property but with “buy and hold”, most times it means
      collecting rents. Strategy #6 &#8211 REIT&sbquo;s
    </p>
    <p>
      REIT stands for “Real Estate Investment Trust” and is, basically, a
      company that owns and manage a portfolio of real estate properties and
      mortgages. You can buy shares in a REIT much the same way you buy stocks
      in other companies. Then, you&sbquo;re paid dividends annually or
      quarterly whichever way it&sbquo;s set up for that particular REIT. This
      is another way to invest in real estate without putting up a lot of money.
      You can invest in some REIT&sbquo;s for as little as $500.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, that&sbquo;s basically, six strategies to wrap your mind around. As I
      said, you can do one or do more over time. Try to pick one that would make
      the most sense for where you are right now in your life. We&sbquo;ll get
      further into details in the following editions but if you can&sbquo;t
      wait, you can research them on your own. There&sbquo;s plenty of info out
      there on each of them. Good luck and I wish you massive success in
      whichever one(s) you choose!

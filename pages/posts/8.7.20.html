    <h2>All About Creative Financing</h2>
    <p>
      We all know just going to the bank to get a loan doesn&sbquo;t work for
      everyone. As a matter of fact, I would venture to say, it doesn&sbquo;t
      work for most. I know investors who have great credit scores and money in
      the bank and still have problems getting “traditional” loans. That&sbquo;s
      why alternative or “creative” financing was invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are all creative financing techniques created equal? The answer is no, but
      the point is to know what is possible so you can find your own creative
      ways to make one (or more) work for you. Here are a few methods to get you
      thinking:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        No-doc and low-doc loans. No (or low) documentation of your income or
        credit required. You can find lenders that do these online now. The
        catch is that you will only be able to borrow up to 70 of the purchase
        price or property value in most cases. If you&sbquo;re short on cash,
        say for instance, you have only 10% in cash, you might be able to make
        arrangements with the seller for the other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seller-carried second mortgages. If a lender will only loan you 70 of
        what you need, they may allow the seller to take back a second mortgage
        from you for 10, so you will only have to come up with 5 for a down
        payment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seller Financing. This just means the seller carries the full note and
        lets you make payments, then, delivers the title upon payment in full. I
        sold a rental this way for $1,000 down, because the Buyer didn&sbquo;t
        qualify for a traditional mortgage and I didn&sbquo;t mind making the 9%
        interest I was getting. Also, the Buyer didn&sbquo;t have to come up
        with 20% down and pay 12% interest to a hard lender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credit cards. If a seller will take $5,000 down on a fixer-upper that
        you expect to make $20,000 on, why not use credit cards? This is a true
        nothing-down deal for you, and if you turn the project in six months,
        you will have only paid $450 in interest on an 18% credit card.
      </li>
      <li>
        Retirement accounts (Self-directed IRA&sbquo;s). The laws get pretty
        complex in this area, but you can check with a tax attorney to see how
        you might borrow from your own retirement account to finance real estate
        investments or talk Private Investors into using theirs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Private Lenders. There are private lenders out there who are only
        interested in passive returns who will loan their money on real estate
        deals that promise them a much higher return on their money (usually 8
        or higher), rather than letting it sit in the bank getting 1% or 2%
        annually. These investors can be found in places like local REIA (Real
        Estate Investors Association) meetings, local IRA groups, online real
        estate platforms and, sometimes, even family members or friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a loan on another property. You can take out a home equity loan on
        your primary home (and, conveniently, forget to use it for that spare
        room you were going to build) but, instead, use it for the down payment
        on an investment property. If it&sbquo;s a rental property, the rent you
        get should offset whatever payments you might have or if it&sbquo;s a
        fix and flip, once it&sbquo;s completed and sold, you can pay off the
        loan, then take the profits that&sbquo;s left and invest in another
        property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Syndication. For bigger projects like buying an apartment complex, you
        could arrange for five or more investors to each put money into a
        partnership or syndication deal, with your participation being as the
        “Sponsor” or Managing Partner in exchange for your share of the equity.
        The Sponsor oversees the project and is the point person for the General
        Partnership. As a sponsor, you can be paid a fee for putting the deal
        together, then a monthly fee for overseeing the project, and also a
        “dissolution” fee when the project is sold.

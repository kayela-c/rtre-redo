    <h2>
      There are several ways to find sellers who are motivated. Some are free
      and some require a little investment. Let&sbquo;s look at the FREE ways first.
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Driving for Dollars &#8211 this is a popular one. D4D (as it&sbquo;s
        sometimes referred to) is nothing but choosing a neighborhood that
        you&sbquo;re interested in and driving each street looking for either
        vacant houses or houses with “For Sale By Owner” signs. You&sbquo;re not
        looking for realtor signs because realtor contracts cannot be assigned
        and, usually, those are houses that are being sold at market value. As
        we discussed last week, when you&sbquo;re wholesaling, you&sbquo;re
        looking for houses that can possibly be bought for 30%-50% below market
        value ideally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Online &#8211 Though they&sbquo;re not easy to find, some deals can be found
        on sites such as “For Sale By Owner” (FSBO), Craigslist, FB Marketplace
        and Zillow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Networking &#8211 Going to local REIA (Real Estate Investors Association)
        meetings in your area is a good place to find deals AND investors. Also,
        networking with service people in your community such as mailmen, yard
        guys, utility workers, etc. and offering referral fees for leads can be
        a good way to find deals. Let them know what you&sbquo;re looking for
        and tell them you&sbquo;ll compensate them if their lead(s) results in a
        sale. You&sbquo;ll be surprised how people will respond to the
        possibility of making an extra $250-$500 if all they have to do is
        provide an address!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PAID Methods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bandit Signs &#8211 Many wholesalers use bandit signs around neighborhoods
        and in high visibility areas such as street corners. All you need to
        write is a simple, “WE BUY HOUSES” and a phone # on the sign. However,
        you have to know the legalities of your area when it comes to bandit
        signs. Some cities only allow them to be posted in certain areas and at
        certain times like on weekends. Also, in order for them to be effective,
        you really need to put out at least 20-30 at a time around the city.
      </li>
      <li>
        Direct Mail &#8211 Direct mail is probably the most expensive form of
        marketing depending on how many pieces you mail at a time. The way it
        works is that you send letters or postcards to a list of owners in a
        certain area letting them know you&sbquo;re looking to buy a home in
        that area and to give you a call if they&sbquo;re interested in selling.
        It doesn&sbquo;t have to be complicated. Here&sbquo;s a sample message:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="example-form">
      <p>Hi Mr/Ms _______________</p>
      <p>
        My name is ____________ and I am interested in buying a home in your
        area within the next 30 days. I understand you own the property at
        __________________________.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in selling at this time, please give me a call at
        __________________ to discuss. Thanks for your time.
      </p>
      <p>Your name</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      You can get a mailing list from a list provider such as `ListSource” or
      Flipthisrealestatelist.com for “vacant houses”, “absentee owners” or “tax
      liens” and include the criteria you&sbquo;re interested in such as zip
      code, type of property, % of equity, etc. Once you have your list, you can
      either mail manually (which I don&sbquo;t suggest) or you can use a mail
      service such as “click2mail” to mail your letters or postcards. The idea
      is to get motivated sellers calling you which saves you having to go look
      for them. I have used this method with lots of success!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Real Estate Software &#8211 There is software such as Propstream that gives
        you the ability to download lists from their program. It is also helpful
        in finding Owner&sbquo;s contact info for houses you might find through
        Driving for Dollars and pulling up area comps. This type of software
        also hosts a lot of other features that can be useful. However, it comes
        with a monthly subscription which can be well worth it if you&sbquo;re
        committed to doing this business. But, if you&sbquo;re not sure, most
        programs come with a free trial so you can test it out before diving in.

      Hi, Lena, again. Since this is our first edition, I want to share with you
      my personal story of how I got started in real estate. So, about 5 years
      ago, I was newly divorced, unemployed, broke and disgusted. I wasn’t sure
      what I was going to do but I knew I had to find a way to solve my
      financial dilemma. So, I remember being online looking for a quick way to
      make some money and I stumbled across information about “wholesaling” real
      estate which I’d never heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, wholesaling in real estate
      is finding a property for sale (usually one in need of repairs or
      distressed in some way), contacting the owner, negotiating a sale price
      that is (ideally) 30% or more below market value, getting the property
      under contract (you can do this without any money changing hands but we’ll
      discuss that later), then finding a buyer (typically an investor looking
      for these kind of houses) and selling the “contract” to the buyer for a
      higher price than what you put it under contract for. At closing, you make
      the difference between the amount you put it under contract for and what
      you sold the contract to the buyer for.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, let’s say you put a house under contract for $60,000 but the
      After Repair Value (ARV) is $100,000 for a house like that in that
      neighborhood. Let’s say you find a buyer interested in the home and you
      `assign’ the contract to him for $70,000. Then at closing, you make the
      difference between your contract price with seller and your assignment
      price to buyer. You walk out with $10,000! And, all you really did was put
      a seller and buyer together, and NO, this is not the same as being an
      agent and NO, you don’t have to have a license for this! (I’ll explain the
      difference between this and being an agent in a later edition.) However,
      this is basically it in a nutshell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t believe how simple it was once I delved further into it. Is
      there a learning curve involved? Definitely. You will have to educate
      yourself to know what to do at each stage but we will help you with that
      in the next few editions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But getting back to my personal story, once I learned more about it and
      felt confident to go out to do my first deal, I went all in. I did
      everything I had read about to do to look for my first property. I
      definitely learned by trial and error because the first couple of
      properties I went after didn’t work. (That happens when you’re new but I
      was determined.) But then I found one that did work! I finally got a house
      under contract, then I had 45 days to find a buyer. I, once again, did all
      the things I had read about that I should do to find a buyer and
      eventually I found one!
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was in a working class neighborhood but needed a lot of work. I
      was able to get it under contract for $12,000 (like I said, it needed a
      lot of work) and sold it to my buyer for $20,000. I made $8,000 but you
      would have thought it was $80,000! I was so HAPPY! Not only did it help me
      to turn things around financially, but it taught me that I didn’t have to
      wait on somebody to give me a job — that I had options. I decided that day
      that I would never be a slave to another job and so far, I’ve able to
      honor that commitment to myself. Now, I’m not telling people to go out and
      quit their jobs. I just want to present options, so whether you just want
      to supplement what you’re already making, or if you want to eventually
      make enough to replace your income so you can have the choice to work or
      not, I hope this information can help you. So, in coming editions, we will
      delve deeper into these options which I hope will arm you with what you
      need to Rock the Real Estate!

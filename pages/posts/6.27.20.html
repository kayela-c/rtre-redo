    <h1>How to Find Buyers</h1>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      When I got my first house under contract, there were a lot of things I
      didn&sbquo;t know about finding buyers (like most people starting out), so
      I had to build what eventually became my Buyer&sbquo;s List one name at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quickest way I found was, whenever I had a deal, to put it on
      Craigslist. If it&sbquo;s a good deal, you&sbquo;ll definitely get calls.
      After they asked their questions, then I would ask THEM questions, “What
      kind of properties were they looking for?” “What areas were they looking
      to buy in?”, etc. You qualify them, while they&sbquo;re trying to qualify
      the deal. That way even if they don&sbquo;t buy that deal, you now have
      their info for future deals you find. I got quite a few buyers that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, once you sell the property, don&sbquo;t take the ads down because
      you will still get calls. Then you call tell them that the house
      they&sbquo;re calling about was sold but you can call them for the next
      deal(s). There are other sites like myhousedeals.com and other classified
      sites you can post on as well but Craigslist is still the mother of them
      all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, when I first started, I didn&sbquo;t know what a REIA (Real Estate
      Investors Association) was. Turns out, most cities have one or some
      variation of it, and they get together once or twice a month to share
      information and network. It&sbquo;s a great place to meet potential
      Buyers. The downside of Craigslist is that you get a lot of tire kickers
      who are not always real investors but at REIA meetings, you meet real
      deal, active investors who are almost always looking for the next good
      deal!
    </p>

      Later, after I had been wholesaling for a while, I found out that another
      great way to find Buyers is to find out what LLC&sbquo;s owned properties
      in the area where the property you&sbquo;re selling is located. An LLC
      usually implies its owned by an investor and if they already own
      properties in the area, chances are they may be open to buying more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, there are more hi-tech ways to find these kind of investors with
      software like Propstream or Deal Machine or list providers that sell “cash
      buyers” lists if you want to spend the money. But, if you&sbquo;re
      starting out and don&sbquo;t have a lot of cash, you might want to do it
      the old-fashion way and that is by looking them up through the tax
      assessor&sbquo;s office for that county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessing records is different in every State but where I live, it&sbquo;s
      online and if you put in a street name without a house number, then all
      the records for that street will come up. You can then see which ones are
      owned by LLC&sbquo;s. I usually do all surrounding streets to the property
      I have under contract. Then, I look up those LLC&sbquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way is partnering with other Wholesalers who have Buyers lists and
      offering them a percentage of your deal if they market your property to
      their list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people call numbers on “For Rent” signs as a way to find Buyers or
      call landlords of apartment buildings. All these things can lead to
      finding Buyers for your properties. It&sbquo;s not that difficult but it
      does take time and work. The good thing is you don&sbquo;t need a ton of
      names. All you need is a few really solid Buyers who are always open to a
      good deal. It&sbquo;s quality over quantity.
